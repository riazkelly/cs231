Note:
We were unable to run programs fast enough to get significant results for 2-word-concatenated passwords, so we were only aiming to crack single word passwords.

Part 1
Passwords cracked: 1162
Total time: .761s
Number of hashes computed: 267751
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: ~.004 passwords/hash
Time per password cracked: .0006s/passwords

Part 2
Passwords cracked: 1133
Total time: 24 minutes 22.256 seconds
Number of hashes computed: 622788826
Passwords cracked per number of hashes computed: 0.00000182 passwords/hash
Time per password cracked: 0.0215 seconds/passwords


Factor by which your time per password lengthened, and why.
Times 35.83. This is because the number of hashes computed is much higher.
